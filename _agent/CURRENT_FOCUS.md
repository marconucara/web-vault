# Current Focus

This file is the LIVE SNAPSHOT of any in-flight session. It is short on purpose
— the durable record lives in git (`git log`), `_agent/WORKLOG.md`, and
`plan/done/`. The queued work lives in `plan/todo/`.

If status files and git disagree, git is authoritative; correct this file.

## Active state

- **Branch:** main
- **Active item:** none in flight.
- **Blockers:** none.
- **Uncommitted work:** none.

## Last shipped

- **ADR `0035` — starter template (2026-08-01).** The one-click entry point is
  the standalone `marconucara/web-vault-template` repository, not a subfolder
  here: the deploy button rejects a subfolder with no root `wrangler.toml`,
  failing before the screen where **Path** is set. `templates/base/` was tried
  and reverted (`c3098da`). ADR 0035 gained acceptance criteria 6 and 7 — the
  one-click path does not reshape the product, and the template is a real vault.
  See `plan/done/2026-08-01-template-separate-repo.md`.
- **`v0.3.0`** — dev-server CJS/ESM interop fix for the editor stack: `wv dev`
  was blanking with "does not provide an export named ..." for plain-CJS
  transitive deps (`style-to-js` via react-markdown; `use-sync-external-store`
  via zustand/BlockNote). Fixed by pre-bundling the affected libraries in Vite
  `optimizeDeps.include` (`lib/vite-config.mjs`). Dev-only; the Rollup build was
  never affected. Verified in-browser on a real install. See
  `plan/done/2026-07-30-dev-editor-cjs-interop.md`.
- **`v0.2.0`** — ADR `0029` delivery: agent-driven onboarding spec (`SETUP.md`),
  user-facing `README.md`, single-source `DEPLOY.md`; product name **WebVault**;
  AGPL-3.0. The build now generates `dist/_headers` (ADR `0026` r2,
  consumer-overridable) rather than scaffolding it. Onboarding UX validated on a
  clean vault.
- All ADRs `0001`–`0029` are **Implemented**. See `INDEX.md`.

## Next item

- Queue empty (`plan/todo/` has no items). No work in flight.

## Environment notes for a fresh agent

- Commits in THIS repo are **SSH-signed** (local config: `gpg.format=ssh`,
  `user.signingkey=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`; author Marco Nucara <marco.nucara@gmail.com>).
- **Never** add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or `Claude-Session:` trailers to commits.
- Keep the package **vault-agnostic**: the consumer lives in a separate repo; no
  hardcoded vault identity here.
