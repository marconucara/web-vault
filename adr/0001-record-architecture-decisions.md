# ADR 0001 — Record architecture decisions as ADRs

## Context

web-vault needs its significant decisions to be **discoverable, traceable, and
durable** — not held in chat logs, pull-request threads, or one person's
memory. The project already carried a substantial, undocumented decision
history (in a plan file and the vault's git log) before this catalogue existed.
The lightweight Architecture Decision Record practice (Michael Nygard, 2011; the
markdown-ADR convention) records each decision as one small, numbered file
stored beside the code, so the reasons behind the system are part of the
repository.

## Capability statement

This repository is **documentation-led and ADR-driven**: every significant
decision is recorded as a numbered ADR under `adr/`; the catalogue is the
**source of truth** the running system is expected to match; and a status
lifecycle drives a `plan/` work queue. The authoring rules — ADR shape, status
lifecycle, numbering, audit trail, and git contract — live in `CONVENTIONS.md`.
This ADR records the **decision to adopt the practice**, not the rules
themselves.

## User stories / scenarios

- As a contributor, I find the reasons behind this system in the catalogue, not
  by asking someone.
- As a maintainer, each decision, the work that implements it, and the commit
  that ships it are linked through one stable identifier.
- As a new reader, the first ADR explains why this repository uses ADRs and
  points me at where the rules live.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Significant decisions are recorded as numbered ADRs under `adr/`, following
   `CONVENTIONS.md`.
2. The catalogue is the source of truth; code is expected to match the
   decisions it records.
3. ADR authoring, the status lifecycle, and the `plan/` queue follow
   `CONVENTIONS.md`.

## Out of scope

- The detailed authoring rules (ADR shape, lifecycle, numbering, git contract)
  — these live in `CONVENTIONS.md`, not here.

## Open questions

- None.
